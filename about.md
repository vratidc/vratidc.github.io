</figure> 

The IMXD Lab provides a space for developing and testing virtual and mixed reality experiences. The lab is equipped with a variety of VR headsets, including HTC Vive, Meta Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest Pro, along with a Microsoft HoloLens for mixed reality applications. It also includes devices for testing augmented reality experiences across different platforms. For projects involving character animation and movement, the lab makes use of an XSense motion capture suit with hand trackers. These facilities support students and researchers in exploring new ideas and creating immersive applications.

## Outreach Activities

Beyond its core research and design work, the IMXD Lab actively engages in outreach through courses, workshops, and public-facing events. Over the years, the lab has contributed to immersive media education through dedicated academic courses and hands-on workshops for students and practitioners. The lab also organises project demonstrations, student exhibitions, and collaborative sessions, creating opportunities to share knowledge and engage with wider audiences both within and outside the university.
