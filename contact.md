**Internship at IMXD Lab**

Each year, we accept a select number of intern students based on the on-going projects in the lab.

One of the options to apply is through the [IIT Bombay Research Internship Awards](https://www.ircc.iitb.ac.in/IRCC-Webpage/IITBInternship/){:target="_blank"} program. These interns get the opportunity to work with us during the Spring Semester (January to July). Applications for this program typically open around August to September.
