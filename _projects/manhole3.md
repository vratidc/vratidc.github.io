"Marita-Jeevita" (Purity-Impurity) is part of a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/manhole-project" target="_blank" style="color:#cc9200;">larger project</a> and an extension of our earlier works â€” the 3D animated short "Manhole" (2022) and the VR experience "Into the Manhole" (2024-25). This project will be developed as a graphic novel and a 2D animated film, delving deeper into the themes of caste, power and resistance.

Set in the fictional city of Mahangar, the story follows an oppressed individual who discovers a reticent suit that grants them extraordinary abilities. As they navigate a society rigidly divided by notions of purity and impurity, they must confront whether power alone can dismantle deep-seated injustice.

Currently in pre-production at IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay, the project is at the character design and narrative development stage.
