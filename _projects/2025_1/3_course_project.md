overview: Vilomah is a 360° film about a father who has lost his child. Viewers see the world from his point of view, where everyday spaces slowly fill with memories of what is gone. The film experiments with monoscopic VR, shifting points of view, and sound cues to guide the audience through his journey of grief.<br><br>
