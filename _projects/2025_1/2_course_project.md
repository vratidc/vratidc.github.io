overview: REWIND is a time-bending VR puzzle game where players manipulate events by reversing time instead of acting forward. Each challenge demands non-linear thinking, as cause and effect are unraveled in reverse. Objects, pathways, and interactions transform when rewound, forcing players to discover hidden logic. The game blends spatial reasoning with temporal inversion, creating puzzles that can only be solved by undoing rather than doing.<br><br>
