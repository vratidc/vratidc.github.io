overview: After a shipwreck, you find yourself drifting in a small lifeboat. In the distance lies an island, your only hope for survival. Your mission is to row your way there while facing the dangers of the open sea.<br><br>Not all sea creatures are a threat. Some fish can be safely targeted and caught to aid your journey. Collect enough, and you can use them to distract the shark, buying precious time to row forward.<br><br>With two controllers, one for rowing and one for catching fish, you must balance your actions carefully. Move ahead, gather resources, and protect yourself from the shark.<br><br>The goal is simple: reach the island before the shark gets you, and survive the perilous voyage.
