overview: Imagine you’re a shepherd with too many sheep and not enough hands. Every time you call out, instead of coming closer, the sheep scatter further away, your voice sends them bounding in the wrong direction. The challenge? See how many of these mischievous, runaway sheep you can still manage to herd back into the barn. It’s a game of chaos, cleverness, and crowd control. How many will you save before the flock is lost?<br><br>
