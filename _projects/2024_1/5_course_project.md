overview: <i>Maunaraagam</i> is a 360 VR music video that immerses you in a story of separation, where distance slowly unravels the bond between two people. With spatial audio divided into three 120-degree segments, Maunaraagam will let you experience both sides of the story, painting a moving portrait of love slipping through the hands of time and space.
