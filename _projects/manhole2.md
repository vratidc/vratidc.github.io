<strong>Synopsis: </strong> <i>“Compelled by the exigencies of poor economic life and caste identity, Amitabh, a young law graduate, becomes a manual scavenger. One day, to earn some extra money to support his family, he decides to get inside a large unsafe sewer to clear a blockage. He neither has protective gear, nor the accompanying engineer to check for poisonous gases. Will Amitabh come out safely?”</i>
<br><br>

This is a 6 degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) VR narrative experience created using the Unreal game engine. This experience is part of a [larger project](https://imxd.in/manhole-project){:target="_blank"} that aims to spread awareness about the dangers of manual scavenging in India.

## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of film and storytelling, Virtual Reality (VR) is emerging as a transformative medium. Unlike traditional films constrained by a static frame, VR offers a 360-degree canvas that allows audiences to explore stories from multiple perspectives and move within the environment. This shift from passive observation to active participation poses both thrilling opportunities and intricate challenges for narrative creators. Among the vanguard projects exploring this new frontier is "Into the Manhole" a pioneering work that merges the boundaries between film and interactive gaming.
<br><br>
Directed by Jayesh Pillai and Abhishek Varma, with technical direction by Banda Shiva Teja and Uttham Prakash, and sound design by Ananda Bathena, this project ventures into the harsh realities faced by manual scavengers in India, blending compelling storytelling with real-time VR immersion.
