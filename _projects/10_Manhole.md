## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of film and storytelling, Virtual Reality (VR) is emerging as a transformative medium. Unlike traditional films constrained by a static frame, VR offers a 360-degree canvas that allows audiences to explore stories from multiple perspectives and move within the environment. This shift from passive observation to active participation poses both thrilling opportunities and intricate challenges for narrative creators. Among the vanguard projects exploring this new frontier is "Manhole VR," a pioneering work that merges the boundaries between film and interactive gaming.
