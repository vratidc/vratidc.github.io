Expresso was an Interactive Installation created for ***[TypoDay 2019](http://www.typoday.in/2019/index.html)***.

We created an 'expressive typewriter', where the strength and pressure of a key-press directly influenced the thickness and width of the resultant glyph on screen.

We built the typewriter on top of two MIDI electronic keyboards (to be able to capture the key-press pressure), and used the MIDI messages to render different types of a **[*Variable Font*](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/testdrive/demos/variable-fonts/)** through a JavaScript file.

Initially, the setup looked something like this:

Eventually, the keyboards came together and looked a bit cleaner:

A demo of the final setup can be viewed below:
