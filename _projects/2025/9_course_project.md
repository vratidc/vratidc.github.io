overview: ‘Twelve Steps Down’ is a dual-narrative psychological thriller storybook that unfolds in two distinct ways. The printed version presents one narrative, while the AR version, viewing the book in a reverse order, uncovers the hidden truth. Through an intricate overlap of illustrations, the story transforms—what first seems innocent or incomplete takes on a spine-chilling new meaning when viewed with AR. This interplay between the two narratives creates a haunting experience, where perception and reality blur, leaving you to piece together the truth.
