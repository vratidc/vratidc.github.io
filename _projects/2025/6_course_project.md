overview: In Outlier, you’re an astronaut who took a very wrong turn into a black hole and made a total mess of the universe. Oops. Now, a cranky, flickering CRT monitor is your only guide, and it wants you to clean up your cosmic disaster. Teleport through three bizarre worlds—Ocean, Forest, and Desert—hunting for scattered outliers to patch things up. Fix reality, escape the void, and maybe, just maybe, avoid black holes next time.
