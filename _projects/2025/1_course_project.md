overview: MAAP is a 3D file manager for VR, offering an intuitive, gesture-based way to organize and interact with digital files. It removes rigid file trees, allowing users to jump between directories instantly. Instead of traversing through layers, files and folders are spatially arranged, making them easier to find and interact with in 3D space. MAAP utilizes hand gestures, and a passthrough environment, making file management more natural, accessible, and futuristic.
