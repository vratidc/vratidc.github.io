overview: Space Out is a VR experience that puts you in the shoes of someone struggling to stay focused. What starts as a simple task—packing for a trip—quickly falls apart as distractions build and reality blurs. To find your way back, you’ll need to steady your focus, using your hands to clear the haze and regain clarity. Can you fight the drift, or will your mind slip away before time runs out?
