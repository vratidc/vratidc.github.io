## Background

This project explores how digital games can prompt reflection about mindfulness in everyday life. It emerged from observing fast paced, overstimulated urban routines where people often move through spaces without noticing them. The project focuses on walking as a familiar daily activity and asks a simple question: are we actually present while doing it?

Rather than aiming for behavior change, the work is intentionally scoped to **awareness and reflection**, understood as the first step toward change.

## Design Approach

The project began with research into games and interactive systems that slow users down and encourage reflection. Concepts such as the **magic circle of games** and **attention theory** informed the design.

Multiple game ideas were explored through sketches and prototypes, followed by **three iterative pilots** with users. Each iteration increased fidelity, refining mechanics, visuals, sound, and pacing based on playtesting feedback.

The final outcome is a **2.5D narrative game** built around a single core mechanic: **movement and observation cannot happen simultaneously**.

## Objective

To make players reflect on whether they are mindful while walking in real life, by translating everyday distractions such as overthinking, phone use, and music into **exaggerated, memorable in game mechanics**.

## Evaluation & Findings

The game was evaluated with **13 participants** using pre and post game interviews and a mindfulness questionnaire.

### Key findings

- Almost all players drew parallels between the game and their real walking habits  
- The blackout and distraction mechanics were highly memorable  
- Players became more aware of their lack of mindfulness during walks  
- Actual behavior change was minimal, but awareness persisted for some time  

The results suggest that games are effective at triggering reflection, even if they do not directly alter habits.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how subtle shifts in game mechanics can question everyday behaviors and carry meaning beyond the screen. By limiting player agency and exaggerating distractions, the game creates moments of self recognition and reflection.

While behavior change was not the goal, the work shows strong potential for using games as **reflective tools**, and offers a transferable framework for designing experiences that make people pause, notice, and think differently about ordinary actions.
