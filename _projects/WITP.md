## Abstract

This project explores how a digital game can gently prompt people to reflect on mindfulness in everyday life. It focuses on walking, a familiar daily activity that often happens on autopilot due to distractions like overthinking, mobile phones, and constant stimulation. Instead of trying to change behavior directly, the game is designed to create awareness, which is the first step toward reflection.
<br>
The experience uses a simple but unusual game mechanic where movement and observation cannot happen at the same time. Players must slow down, pause, and pay attention to their surroundings to progress. By exaggerating everyday distractions inside the game, the project creates memorable moments that encourage players to notice similar patterns in real life. Through this work, the project explores how game mechanics, pacing, and interaction design can be used as tools to spark reflection beyond the screen.

## Design Approach

The project began with research into games and interactive systems that slow users down and encourage reflection. Concepts such as the **magic circle of games** and **attention theory** informed the design.

Multiple game ideas were explored through sketches and prototypes, followed by **three iterative pilots** with users. Each iteration increased fidelity, refining mechanics, visuals, sound, and pacing based on playtesting feedback.

The final outcome is a **2.5D narrative game** built around a single core mechanic: **movement and observation cannot happen simultaneously**.

### Primary Research

The primary research for this project involved understanding how people experience distraction and mindfulness during everyday walking. This was done through playtesting early versions of the game with participants and conducting follow-up interviews. Players were asked about their habits while walking, such as phone usage, listening to music, and overthinking. Observations during play sessions and reflections shared after gameplay helped identify which mechanics felt relatable, memorable, and reflective of real-life behavior.

### Secondary Research

The secondary research focused on studying existing games, interactive systems, and design literature that explore slowing down, attention, and reflection. Prior work on mindfulness, attention theory, and games designed for reflection was reviewed to understand how mechanics, pacing, and interaction can influence awareness. This research informed the design decisions by highlighting how exaggerated or constrained interactions in games can prompt players to think about their real-world actions.

## Characters

The game uses simple and relatable characters to support reflection rather than storytelling. The main character is a student, chosen for the familiarity of everyday routines like commuting and walking. Other characters appear naturally in the environment to make the world feel lived-in. The minimal and abstract character design helps players project themselves onto the experience and focus on awareness and observation.


## Objective

To make players reflect on whether they are mindful while walking in real life, by translating everyday distractions such as overthinking, phone use, and music into **exaggerated, memorable in game mechanics**.

## Evaluation & Findings

The game was evaluated with **13 participants** using pre and post game interviews and a mindfulness questionnaire.

### Key findings

- Almost all players drew parallels between the game and their real walking habits  
- The blackout and distraction mechanics were highly memorable  
- Players became more aware of their lack of mindfulness during walks  
- Actual behavior change was minimal, but awareness persisted for some time  

The results suggest that games are effective at triggering reflection, even if they do not directly alter habits.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how subtle shifts in game mechanics can question everyday behaviors and carry meaning beyond the screen. By limiting player agency and exaggerating distractions, the game creates moments of self recognition and reflection.

While behavior change was not the goal, the work shows strong potential for using games as **reflective tools**, and offers a transferable framework for designing experiences that make people pause, notice, and think differently about ordinary actions.
