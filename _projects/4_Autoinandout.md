content_one1: Virtual reality experience of a car and exploring its subsystem is the goal of this project. Head mounted display and VR box controller is used as a tool to experience the scenario. By gazing through the display, sub parts specifications of the car are displayed for the viewer. Also, the user can sit or stay in any position for the experience and for moving forward, a controller should be used. For turning all-around, the head mounted display can be viewed all 360 degree. The ultimate aim is to provide detail of all subsystem of every car by just viewing at that point.
