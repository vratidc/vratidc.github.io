I've been sporadically writing songs and composing music for a few years now.
Some of my work can be found on my [***Soundcloud Page***](https://soundcloud.com/iris_official).

For a while I performed as a part of a semi professional blues rock band with five batchmates of mine.
We were called Bluemoss. An image of us performing, for posterity, can be found below.
